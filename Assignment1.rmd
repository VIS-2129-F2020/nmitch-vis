## Selecting and loading variables

I chose to consider data from the 2010 Census for census tracts in my home county of Bartholomew County, Indiana. The continuous variables I consider are percent of households in rented homes (pct_rented), total households made up of only one person (tot_one_person_hh), the percent of housing units that are vacant (pct_vacant), and the total population of the tract (tot_pop). The categorical variables I consider are whether the tract is urban or rural (urban) and the majority gender of the tract (majority_gender). My data includes 15 observations.

``` {r load variables, message=FALSE}
vars <- c(tot_housing_units = "H001001",
          tot_vacant = "H003003",
          tot_one_person_hh = "P019002",
          tot_rented = "H004004",
          tot_urban = "H002002",
          tot_pop = "P003001", 
          tot_female = "P012026",
          tot_male = "P012002")
Barth_tracts <- get_decennial(geography = "tract", variables = vars,
                           state = "IN", county = "Bartholomew",
                           output = "wide") %>%
  mutate(urban = (tot_urban == tot_housing_units) ,
         pct_vacant = tot_vacant / tot_housing_units,
         pct_rented = tot_rented / tot_housing_units,
         majority_gender = case_when(
           tot_female / tot_pop > 0.5 ~ "female",
           tot_male / tot_pop > 0.5 ~ "male",
           TRUE ~ "None")) %>%
  filter(tot_pop > 0, tot_housing_units > 0) %>%
  select(GEOID, urban, majority_gender, pct_rented, pct_vacant, tot_one_person_hh, tot_pop) 

```

## Reflections
It was interesting to explore the different ways that R and its various packages can be used to present data. The various styles were especially fun. If I were to do this over again, I would choose a geography that included more census tracts; a greater number of observations would allow for more thorough exploration of the features and challenges R. With this project, as well as the projects for Quant, I continue to feel more comfortable using R.
